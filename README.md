## Duva
Duva is a distributed cache server aimed at efficient and scalable key-value store operations using Actor models, written in Rust



### Why the Actor model?
Designed to handle concurrent, distributed, and scalable systems, it models independent units of computation (actors) that communicate solely via message passing. 
It offers several advantages, and the following is a non-exhaustive list of pros
- High concurrency: Systems requiring thousands or millions of lightweight concurrent entities.
- Event-driven architecture: Applications that rely on asynchronous event processing.
- Distributed systems: Systems spanning multiple servers or nodes.
- Fault tolerance: Systems where reliability and recovery from failure are critical.


### Features
The following features have been implemented so far:

- Core Commands
    - SET: Store a key-value pair.
        - Expiration: Set a time-to-live (TTL) for keys.
    - GET: Retrieve the value associated with a key.
    - KEYS (with pattern matching): Retrieve keys matching specific patterns.
    - SAVE: dump data to the designated file path

- Advanced Features
    - Auto Deletion: Automatically remove expired keys.
    - Local Sharding: Efficiently manage data distribution across local actors.
    - Configuration Settings: Customize server behavior with adjustable configurations.
    - Persistence:
        - Dump data into an rdb file (similar to Redis’ dump.rdb).
        - Append Only File

- Protocol Support
    - RESP Protocol: Fully implemented for parsing client requests, ensuring compatibility with Redis-like commands.



### Diagrams
#### Client request control
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor C as Client
    participant CC as ClientRequestController
    participant Stream
    participant CA as CacheActor
    participant Config as ConfigManager
    
    
    loop wait for connection
        activate CC
        C ->> CC: Make Stream
        CC --) Stream : Spawn Stream
        deactivate CC    
    end

    loop 
        Stream --)+ Stream: wait & receive request

                Stream -) CA: route request
                CA -) Stream: return response
            else config
                Stream -) Config: route request
                Config -) Stream: return response
            end
                Stream -)- Stream: send response
            
        end
    end

```

#### Clustering
```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
    participant s as MasterServer
    
    
    actor Cache
    actor Config
    actor Cluster
    actor peer_listener
    
    actor client_listener
    participant SlaveServer
    actor slave_peer_listener

    par 
        s-->>Cache: spawn
    and 
        s-->>Config: spawn
    and 
        s-->>Cluster: spawn
        Cluster --> Cluster : send heartbeat
        Note right of Cluster : Cluster periodically sends heartbeat to peers 
    and
        s -->>client_listener:spawn
        
    and 
        SlaveServer -->> slave_peer_listener: spawn 
        Note right of SlaveServer : SlaveServer also listens for incoming peer connections
    and 
    

        
        s-->>peer_listener: spawn
        
        loop 
        
            SlaveServer -->>+ peer_listener: bind 
            peer_listener -->- SlaveServer: threeway handshake
            peer_listener -->> SlaveServer : disseminate peer infomation
            peer_listener -->>+ Cluster : pass stream
            Cluster -->>- Cluster : add peer

        
        end
        
  
    end

```

## Strong consistency with Raft(RFC)

### Election (normal flow)
There are two timeout settings which control elections.
- `Election timeout` : amount of time a follower waits until becoming a candidate, randomized to be between 150-300ms
  - After elecction timeout, the follower becomes a candidate and start a new election term. In this case system:
    - increases value `term` by 1
    - starts counting voting(which is from 1 as it votes for itself)
    - sends `Request Vote` messages to other nodes
  - If the receiving node hasn't voted YET in this term, it votes for the candidate and resets its election timeout(and increase its `term` by 1 and mark it's voting state for candidate -> `Vote for` state).
  - Once a candiate gets a majority of votes, it becomes a leader. 
  
- The leader begins sending out `Append Entries` messages to its followers, the interval of which is specified by the `heartbeat timeout`
  - Followers get `Append Entries` and then change state from `Vote for: {node identifier}` ->  `Leader : {leader_node identifier}`
  - The election term continues until a follower stops receiving heartbeats and becomes a candidate


### Election in split brain
- If two candidates occur at the same time, it causes race. Let's say we have two candidates(A,B) and two potential followers(C,D).
- `Request Vote` arrives at two node(C,D) 
  - C votes for A
  - D votes for B
- Now, each candidate has 2 votes and can receive no more for this term.
- Then EVERY NODES wait one more round of `election timeout` and send `Request vote` again.




### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)



Build the project:

```sh
cargo run
```

If you have dump file, and you can load them up on start-up,
```sh
cargo run -- --dir directory-path --dbfilename filename
```



### Protocol
This server supports the RESP Protocol, enabling interaction with clients in a familiar Redis-like manner.

### Roadmap
Future enhancements may include:

- Distributed sharding
- Replication
    - Anti-entropy mechanism (dotted version vector)
    - Dissemination (TBD)
- Pub/Sub support
- More advanced data types (e.g., lists, sets, hashes)
- Write-through / read-through support
